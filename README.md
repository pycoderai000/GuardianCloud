- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Seamlessly integrate with various cloud providers, including AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
- **Automated Compliance**: Automatically enforce compliance standards and generate reports for audits.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously monitor cloud environments for anomalies and security threats.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale security policies and detection rules across multiple environments.
- **Integration**: Integrate with existing CI/CD pipelines for continuous security testing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Docker (optional, for containerized environments)
- Cloud provider CLI tools (AWS CLI, Azure CLI, Google Cloud SDK)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pycoderai000/GuardianCloud.git
   cd GuardianCloud
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Cloud Providers**

   - AWS: Set up AWS CLI and configure credentials.
   - Azure: Install Azure CLI and authenticate.
   - Google Cloud: Install Google Cloud SDK and authenticate.

4. **Deploy Cloud-Warden**

   ```bash
   python setup.py install
   ```

### Usage

1. **Define Detection Rules**

   Create YAML or JSON files to define your security policies and detection rules. Example:

   ```yaml
   policy_name: "S3 Bucket Public Access"
   description: "Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible"
   severity: "High"
   detection_rule:
     type: "AWS"
     resource: "s3"
     condition: "not(contains(s3.acl, 'public-read'))"
   ```

2. **Deploy Rules**

   Use the Cloud-Warden CLI to deploy your detection rules:

   ```bash
   cloud-warden deploy --rules path/to/rules.yaml
   ```

3. **Monitor and Report**

   Monitor your cloud environments in real-time and generate compliance reports:

   ```bash
   cloud-warden monitor --environment production
   cloud-warden report --output report.pdf
   ```
